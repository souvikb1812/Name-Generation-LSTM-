This repository consistes of three files. 

1)training.py: This contains the code where the model is trained on a dataset of 2000 names.
3)weights.model: This contains the weights of the training.py model.
3)inference.py: This contains the code which accepts a pre-trained weight model and asks the user to enter any letter. It then generates twenty names starting with the entered letter.
